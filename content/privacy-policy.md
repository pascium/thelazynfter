I believe in transparency, that is why you will find all the information you need about your online privacy while visiting my website.

Keep in mind that this policy is not respected by websiteâ€™s I link to, so always read their privacy policy before using their services or sign-up to their newsletter.

## Personal information.

I collect your name, email and message content when you contact me via my contact form.

This information is kept on google drive storage until both parties are satisfied with the outcome.

When you sign-up for my free downloads or guides, you will be asked to provide your name and email, this is also stored in the google drive storage and will be used to email you with helpful tips and tricks.

You can always request to have your name and email deleted from this list by contacting me via my privacy form.
Data sharing.
By default I do NOT share, sell or rent any of the information you have provided with anyone.

When you use my affiliate links, third-parties will store your data differently than how I do this, so make sure to check their privacy policy accordingly.

## Cookies and trackers.

My website is free from trackers and other analytics and browser fingerprint methods.

Exceptions to this rule are my affiliate links, these links will set a cookie in your browser for at least 24 hour, this is only done when you click on the affiliate links.

You can always block these by using an adblocker like Ublock origin or Adguard browser extension.

Another option is to block all cookies, this can be done in your browser settings.

## Updates.

If anything changes in my online practices that will impact your online privacy, this page will be updated accordingly.

Key updates and changes will be posted below.
