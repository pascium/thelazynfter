## Affiliate And Sponsored Content.

I use affiliate links to provide a way for us to earn income from my website/blog without having to use ads.

These affiliate links are at no cost to you, the seller or affiliate network is covering the cost and will pay me for referring you to them.

This means you wonâ€™t pay for anything extra.

It is also possible that I get paid to review products, but this will not reflect on my opinion or review quality.

If the product is not good or the experience is below my recommendations, then I will not recommend the product even if I get paid to review it.

because affiliate links are from external third-parties they can impact your privacy in a certain way, that is why you need to read my privacy policy for more information.
