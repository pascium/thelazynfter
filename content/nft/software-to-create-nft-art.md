Here is a short list of tools you can use to make NFT art by yourself.

* Adobe Photoshop.
* Blender.
* Inkscape.
* Google Draw.
* AI Text to Art generators.
* MagicaVoxel.

While there are many other programs out there, the above mentioned tools are in my oppinion the most used for NFT and other art prjects.

I know that listing a bunch of tools wont help you in picking the right one for your project.

So in the rest of this article I will explain to you the pro's and con's of each one.

This way you know what tool to pick, scroll down and read what I think about these tools.

## Adobe Photoshop.

Photoshop is one of the more poupular image manipulation software you can buy online.

This tool is used by professional photographers and artist around the world.

It has almost become the facto standard for artist to use when it comes to image manipulation programs, just because many pro's are using it.

Becasue of this, I don't like Photoshop.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great tool if you have the experience. 

But for me it's way to expensive and complicated to use.

### What I like about Photoshop.

* Wide range of build in tools.
* Very powerful in the right hands.
* Good customer support.
* Many tutorials online.

### What I dislike about Photoshop.

* Monthly subscription.
* Complex UI (user interface).
* higher learning curve for absolute beginners.
* Only for Windows and macOS.

## Blender.

The most powerful open source 3D modeling software you can get without spending a single dime.

You can make space models, VTUBER characters, 3D animations and the list goes on.

But just like Photoshop, Blender has a high learning curve.

That is why I recomend Blender to professions, and not beginners that just want to make NFTs.

You are free to download and try it out for yourself, but be warned, you WILL need YouTube tutorials to get started.

### My Blender pro's.

* Free.
* Creating animations are build in.
* You have full control.
* Open source.
* Many tutorials online.
* Big community for support.
* Supports Linux, Windows and macOS.
* Layered textures design.
* AMD, Apple, Intel, and NVIDIA hardware support.

### Blender warning signs.

* High leaning curve.
* Only community support.
* Render engine can be hard on older systems recourses.
* No cloud storage syncing.

## Inkscape.
Is a free vector based program just like Photoshop, some say that Inkscape is the best free alternative for Adobe Photoshop.

While I understand why they say that, personally I think Photoshop has a nicer user interface and looks overall better than Inkscape.

But are looks and nicer interface worth the monthly expenses? That’s up to you to decide.

### Inkscape pro's.
 
 * Free.
 * Vector based.
 * Supports Linux, Windows and macOS.
 * Broad file format compatibility.
 * Flexible drawing tools.
 * Bezier and spiro curves included.
 * Photoshop alternative.

### Inkscape con's.

* Only community support.
* No cloud storage syncing.
* Similar look to photoshop.

## Google draw.

Not the first web based program you think of NFT creation, but in the right hands it can be quite useful.

While you can’t do animations like in blender and photoshop, it’s free and anyone with a google account has direct access to it.

For an impression on what you can make with google draw. 

Search for “Joshua Pomeroy google draw” in the YouTube search bar and watch his videos, they are awesome.

### Pro's of google draw.

* Cloud based.
* Free for google users.
* Build into google drive.
* Easy to use.
* Free geometric shapes.
* SVG export supported.

### Con's of google draw.

* Very simplstic.
* No animations.
* Lack of powerful tools.

## AI art generators.

These are special created pieces of machine learning algorithems that can create images "art" from just your text input.

Great for people that can't draw or just want to speed up the process.

A simple google search, shows that allot of companies have created online tools that can do this, but at a high price.

But what if I told you that there is a way to have the same powerful tool right inside your google account but without any cost, would you belive me?

The thumbnail of this article was created with this tool, if you would like to know more about this free AI art tool.

Check out my free text to art guide.

### AI art generator pro's.

* Can make any image you want.
* Fast.
* No coding skills needed.

### Con's of AI art generators.

* Heavy on resources.
* Need pro account for longer sessions.
* Only GPU rendering supported.
* Commercial companies are expensive.
* Self hosted needs high-end hardware.

## MagicaVoxel.

A free to use 3D voxel editor which you can use to create models or worlds for your games, animations, or other creative projects. 

You don’t need any prior experience or skills in 3D modelling!

The program offers a wide range of tools and features that you can use to create your 3D designs. These include:

* A variety of shapes and primitives that you can use as the basis for your designs.
* A selection of textures and materials that you can apply to your objects.
* Tools for editing and shaping your objects.

### MagicaVoxel pro's.

* Free to use for any project.
* Credits to the software maker are not required.
* No monthly subscribtions.
* Lightweight GPU-based.
* Path tracing renderer.
* Clean UI.

### MagicaVoxel con's.

* Only macOS and Windows.
* No option for commandline.
* Only small sizes (256 x 256 x 256).
* Hard to ajust camera angle.
* No support.
* Bad model mesh exporting.

## So what software should you use to make NFTs?

It all depends on the budget and what NFT you want to make.

If you lack drawing skill like me, then an AI art generator would be your best option.

When you want to turn your image manipulation skills into a job and work as a freelancer, then Photoshop is a no brainer.

For 3D rendering I always reccomend Blender, it's free plus you cn do awesome stuff with it.

Blender can also be used in the movie and animation branch, so freelancing could be an option if you want to go into the entertainment industrie.
