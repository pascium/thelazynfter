In 2022, it may be a little harder to pull off the same old scams that we have come to know over the past years, but just like technology, hackers and scammers will find new way’s to steal shit from you.

## NFTs will become the most common medium of exchange in 2022!

NFTs (or Non Fungible Tokens) have recently become a popular topic in the crypto community. Some say they will replace ETH, while others claim they are just a fad and won’t last.

But no matter what the experts say, it is clear that NFTs will play a big role in the future of crypto—and that they are already changing the way people use crypto.

NFTs enable the owner to do more with their tokens than just trade them on an exchange. In fact, there are already several platforms that support NFTs. These platforms are helping to

## What are the different types of NFT scams to look out for?

NFT scam is one of the most common scams in the blockchain community. It is a type of scam that sells tokenized assets on a centralized exchange, and continues to trade it as if it were an NFT.

Therefore, its price will increase, and exchanges will add it to their books.

The scammer can sell the token at any time and make huge profits. The only people who get hurt are those who buy the token.

The price of the token increases without any real value for the buyer or society.

_The most common scams that you should be aware of include:_

### Shills or shilling scams.

The first type of NFT scams are “shills”. Shills are basically like shilling on the internet for which people have been banned from different websites and social media platforms.

They promote their own token or coin to get more people to buy it. They do this by creating fake news and posting on social media, forums, and other websites.

### Pump and Dump scams.

The second type of NFT scams is a “pump and dump” scheme.

This is when someone builds up hype around a coin or token over social media and then dumps it right before it goes up in value. This is also

### NFT Artwork counterfeiting.

NFTs artworks are a kind of digital asset.

From the beginning, they can be copied and replicated very easily.

Although the blockchain technology ensures that each token is unique, it is still possible to simply create a new token with the same artwork.

This makes it very hard for collectors to verify whether or not the piece they have purchased is original.

The ArtChain Global platform will change this with its blockchain-based system for art authentication.

With the help of this system, collectors will be able to verify the authenticity of their NFT artwork tokens, which will also protect them from being deceived by fake

### Fake non-fungible token exchanges.

In the world of blockchain, a non-fungible token is a digital token that is unique and can be owned by one person at a time.

Non-fungible tokens are used to represent collectibles like CryptoKitties, in-game items like CryptoPunks, or even tickets like in Block Party.

A fake ERC-721 exchange is a service that allows people to trade their non-fungible tokens for other non-fungible tokens.

The most popular such service allows users to trade in-game items on blockchain, thereby allowing for the growth of a secondary market. You can read more about it here:

### Fake NFT token games.

I’m not sure how many other people have noticed it, but there are a lot of fake NFT token games out there.

The goal of these games is to get you to buy Ethereum with your own money and buy in-game tokens with it, but you get fake coins instead.

This way you lose your Ethereum assets and there is no way of getting it back.

The scammer can do anything with the Ethereum because it is decentralized without any oversight from banks and financial institutions.

## To wrap things up….

While there are some artists who will be putting in the work to create art, there will also be many people trying to make money off of others.

If you want to avoid being scammed and save your time and energy, take these tips into consideration.
