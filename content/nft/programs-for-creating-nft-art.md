There are many different types of NFT art, which can require a variety of different software programs.

The type of software needed will depend on the medium being used and the artist's specific preferences.

However, there are a few main software programs that most artists will use in order to create their work.

Some are free, some are very expensive, the most important thing is that you have the skills and imagination necessary to design your own creations.

## Why you should use software to create your NFT art

There are many apps out there that make the creation of non-fungible tokens easier.

An example is CryptoKit. CryptoKit makes it easy to create your own NFTs on Ethereum, even if you don’t know how to write smart contracts.

Another app is CryptoZombies, where you can learn how to build dApps while also creating your own unique ERC-721 token.

The most popular NFT art we’ve seen was created using CryptoZombies and CryptoKit.

## Where to find your inspiration!

When you’re feeling uninspired and don’t know where to start with your next NFT project, it can be helpful to look to others for inspiration. Luckily, there are plenty of places to find interesting and creative examples of NFTs.

One great way to find inspiration is to browse online galleries and collections of NFTs.

These galleries often showcase the best and most innovative work being done in the NFT space. Another option is to search for specific types of NFTs that interest you.

This can help you find new and innovative ways to use NFTs in your next project.

## Software that can be used to create NFT art!

Nowadays, there are various software’s (free and paid) that you can use to create Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), below you find 4 of my favorite tools that you can use.

### Adobe Photoshop.

Photoshop is a great way for artists who have a lot of experience and are willing to pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee to Adobe.

For beginners or people with a very tight budget I would not recommend Adobe Photoshop, unless you are planning to use Photoshop for your business.

### Blender.

Blender is a very powerful and free tool for creating 3D art, models and animations.

Many businesses are hiring freelance artists that work with blender to make commercials, movie models and many other applications.

While the learning curve is a bit high, that power and flexibility it brings to the table is worth the extra learning curve in my opinion.

You can find  a lot of free tutorial videos available on YouTube on how to use blender.

So if you are thinking of using blender for your next project, check out blender.org for the official download and YouTube for tutorials videos on how to get started.

### Google Draw.

Not the first web based program you think of NFT creation, but in the right hands it can be quite useful.

While you can’t do animations like in blender and photoshop, it’s free and anyone with a google account has direct access to it.

For an impression on what you can make with google draw, search for “Joshua Pomeroy google draw” in the YouTube search bar and watch his videos. They are awesome.

### Inkscape.

Is a free vector based program just like Photoshop, some say that Inkscape is the best free alternative for Adobe Photoshop.

While I understand why they say that, personally I think Photoshop has a nicer user interface and looks overall better than Inkscape.

But are looks and nicer interface worth the monthly expenses? That's up to you to decide.

### AI art generators.

In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made huge leaps and bounds in the field of image recognition and generation.

This has led to the development of AI art generators – computer programs that can create realistic or abstract artworks, without any human input.

Some of the most popular AI art generators are Google’s DeepDream and Prisma. Both of these programs are able to take a simple photo and turn it into a work of art, using various filters and algorithms.

There is no doubt that AI art generators are a fascinating new development in the world of art.

However, some people are concerned that AI art generators are taking away the creativity of artists.

Others believe that these tools are simply providing a new way for artists to express themselves.

### MagicaVoxel.

A free and easy to use 3D voxel editor which you can use to create models or worlds for your games, animations, or other creative projects. You don't need any prior experience or skills in 3D modelling!

The program offers a wide range of tools and features that you can use to create your 3D designs. These include:

- A variety of shapes and primitives that you can use as the basis for your designs
- A selection of textures and materials that you can apply to your objects
- Tools for editing and shaping your objects

### CryptoPainter.

Is a web-based tool, which can be used for creating various types of digital art on the Ethereum blockchain.

You can draw images and upload them to the blockchain. Anyone can purchase your artwork, at any time.

When someone purchases the piece of art, you get the money in return, and you have full ownership over the image forever.

## Conclusion.

There are a variety of programs that can be used to create NFT art.

If you're looking for a free and easy to use software that offers a lot of versatility without monthly fees.
