In this guide I will explain how you can create your own digital NFT and sell it on the OpenSea marketplace.

This tutorial is for complete beginners, keep in mind that others have different ways of creating art than I am going to show you here, so make sure to research different ways and pick the one that fits your needs.

Now that’s out of the way, let's start with the free option first.

## Create NFT Art For Free Online.

When it comes to free options for creating NFT art, you can pick from many tools such as Blender, Canva and Gimp.

But these all require some level of drawing or 3D modeling skills.

Fotor.com on the other hand has a great tool that lets you upload any picture of your own and turn it into NFT art.

**How to use fotor NFT creator:**

*   Go to [https://www.fotor.com/nft-creator/](https://www.fotor.com/nft-creator/).
*   Click on the button “create NFT now”.
*   In the new window select “open image”.
*   Select the image you want to use.
*   Choose a style from the left side.
*   Click download in the top right corner.
*   Select the destination folder on your device.
*   Done.

### NFT Generator.

When you need a very unique piece of art and don’t have the time or skills to draw it yourself, then an AI art generator is a good option.

An art generator “NFT generator” is a piece of machine learning code that uses specially designed algorithms to create images based on the user’s text input.

To make one yourself you can follow YouTube tutorials and build one with Python from scratch.

If coding is not your forte, then try out my free AI art generator guide.

**_This guide will show you how to create art with AI inside your google account plus you can download a ready made colab script that I use 4 times a week for making art._**

## Paid NFT Software.

When free tools don’t gut it for you, then you can check software that is created for professionals. Keep in mind that you WILL need to pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee to use these tools.

Because I am a complete noob when it comes to drawing or 3D rendering, I cannot recommend them so choose it based on your own skill level.

*   Adobe Illustrator.
*   Krita.
*   Hotpot.ai.

## Sell on OpenSea.

OpenSea is a marketplace for digital assets, which means that you can buy, sell, and trade almost any digital item on that platform. 

This includes things like CryptoKitties, game items, digital art, domains, trading cards and more (no illegal or copyrighted stuff of course).

You can buy and sell these items using Ethereum, Polygon and other cryptocurrency networks.

### OpenSea fees.

As an online marketplace, openSea charges a flat fee of 2.5% on all sales. This fee is charged to the seller, and is automatically deducted from the proceeds of the sale.

### how to list NFT on openSea.

OpenSea is a decentralized marketplace for digital assets. It allows users to buy, sell, and trade digital assets directly with each other.

**To list your NFT on OpenSea, follow these steps:**

1.  Go to opensea.io and click in the top right on the wallet icon.
2.  Select the wallet you want to use and sign up.
3.  Go to your profile and create a profile name.
4.  Add a logo, banner images for a professional look.
5.  Add your social-media channels (if any).
6.  Click "Create" on the top right corner of the page.
7.  Upload your digital asset.
8.  Enter a title and description.
9.  Set how many items you have (usually 1).
10.  Pick a blockchain network.
11.  Click "Create” to list the item.
12.  Complete captcha.
13.  Your NFT is now listed on openSea.

Note: your NFT is now listed but not sellable.

**To sell you NFT on openSea you can follow the following steps:**

1.  Select the NFT you want to sell.
2.  Click on sell in the top right of the page.
3.  Set selling price ($5.50 minimum).

5.  Check if fees are correct.
6.  Click on “complete listing”.
7.  Sign the contract with your wallet.
8.  Pay the required gas fees.
9.  NFT is now listed to be purchased.

**Note**: the buyer will pay for the gas fees when they want to buy you digital aset, but if you accept a bid during the active listing period, you will pay for the gas fees.

**_Disclaimer: You will not make millions of dollars selling your NFTs, in fact you WILL lose your money, so think twice before you start selling your digital assets._**

## Conclusion About Selling on OpenSea

While there are many other marketplaces like OpenSea, I would recommend anyone that wants to start with NFTs to go and checkout opensea.io.

They have a friendly UI and the steps are very simple to complete, personally I would start with selling NFT art with the Polygon network.

This network does not have gas fees, this reduces the risk of losing your money and you can focus more on marketing your NFT to your audience.
