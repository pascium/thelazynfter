If you're looking for ways to make an NFTs on a budget, there are a few different ways to do this. Many of them have a relatively low cost associated with them.

Other ways may have a higher start-up cost, but can be worth it for the long term impact.

## what is an NFT?

An NFT is a token that represents something unique, whether it's digital or physical, and each one is different from another.

So if you've ever wanted to create your own digital collectibles, here are a few ways you can do it for almost no money at all.

## cheap tools you can use to make an NFT

1. Adobe Illustrator.
2. Adobe Photoshop.
3. Blender.
4. Google Draw.
5. Inkscape.
6. Gimp.
7. Fiverr.
8. AI Art Generators.
9. Canva.

## Can you make an NFT for free and without fees?

Yes and no, If you are an artist and have the skills to design and make your own art, then yes it can be free, otherwise no because you have to hire someone to make it for you.

Listing your NFT on marketplaces like opensea.io is another story, if you like using Ethereum then no, this is very expensive.

The cost for gas fees on Ethereum can range between $10 and $200, in some cases it can even be more, depending on the gas fees for that day.

That is why I always recommend checking an online gas free tracker, so you can plan your listing according to the current gas fees that you find acceptable.

The free option is to use the Polygon network (MATIC), this is also the network I use on opensea.io in combination with the MetaMask wallet for listing my NFTs.

## Can I sell NFT on OpenSea for free?

Yes, on opensea.io you can lazy mint your NFT for free using the Polygon network, keep in mind that opensea will take 2.5% off the sale price for covering the gas fee.

You can compensate for this by raising the royalty fees to a higher number, like from 2.5% to 5%, you can even go all the way to the max of 10%.

Make sure to pick the right amount of royalty fees because the higher the % of fees the more likely the buyer will not buy your NFT, so keep this in mind when picking the royalty fees.

You also need to keep in mind that if you receive a bid on your NFT and you accept this, you are the one that will pay for the gas fees, otherwise the buyer will have to pay for it.

## Do you pay gas fees on OpenSea?

Yes, if you list your NFT with the Ethereum network, then you pay for the minting fees, if you use the Polygon network, then no.

Keep in mind that if you accept a bid from a buyer while the listing is not ended, then you will pay for the gas fee otherwise the buyer will have to pay for the gas fee.

## Why are OpenSea fees so high?

The more people joining in on the action the higher the price.

You can compare it to advertisers that are bidding against each other for the top ad position on google search results.

The more they are willing to spend, the higher the end price will be.

But this is not the problem with the marketplace itself, it is because of the share amount of miners that is needed to complete the blockchain transaction.

In fact, opensea will only take 2.5% of the sale price as their fee (at the moment of writing this article), but if you use the Polygon network you don’t have any gas fees.

Depending on your budget and what you're willing to pay for listing your NFT is up to you.

If gas fees are not a big deal to you, then looking at other marketplaces with lower fees is a better option.

## Should I Mint my NFT on Polygon or Ethereum?

Both networks can work, the Ethereum network has higher transaction volumes and bigger user base compared to the Polygon network.

The drawback of Ethereum is that you have to pay high gas fees and it’s slower than Polygon.

These gas fees are what keeps me from using Ethereum to list my NFTs, on some days you can pay more than $100 for minting one NFT.

## Is polygon good for NFT?

When you are just starting out and want to see if NFTs are something for you, then using the Polygon network is a solid option just because you don’t have to pay gas fees.

The Ethereum network on the other hand is more popular by professionals, but comes with a very high gas fee.

Personally I would recommend you to pick a network that fits their budget and your marketing strategy.

If you suck at marketing your art or have no social-media followers, then Polygon is the only option I'm comfortable recommending you to use.

Don’t listen to what other people are saying is the best network to use, just pick the network that won't get you into financial problems, and learn how to market your art properly.
