Welcome to my AI art guide. I am so glad that you decided to come and follow this guide.

I will teach you how to use AI to generate unique art right inside your google account without writing any code.

Heck, you can just clone the same AI that I have been using directly to your google drive.

When it's done, you will be redirected to my google drive so you can clone it to your own google drive.

In my Google Collab account, click in the top left corner on file and click in the dropdown on save a copy in drive.

I assume by now that you have a copy of the AI in your google drive, don't worry if you have finished it yet.

You can always go back and clone it from my account once you're done with this tutorial.

## Ok, let's get started with the guide you have come for.

For the AI to generate art, it needs to know what the image must be about.

I will be using the keywords "Neon Night City in Rain unreal engine 5".

You can do the same, but I highly recommend picking a topic that interests you.

### Step 1, Download Library.

The machine-learning algorithm needs 37 different python libraries in order to function properly.

Don't worry you don't have to sit there and install 37 libraries every time your run the AI.

Go to ”Download Everything (Press Play Button to Download Everything)” in the AI that you have cloned in the beginning.

Click the play button and all the required libraries will be downloaded and installed automatically.

Depending on your internet connection, this step can take a few minutes. Once this step is completed you can move on to step 2.

### Step 2, Enter Image Topic.

Here you need to enter the topic or keyword that your image must be about, in my case, it’s “Neon Night City in Rain Unreal Engine 5”.

### Step 3, Select Image Size.

Enter the width and height of the image you want to generate, the maximum for this AI is 500px X 500px.

Personally, I would keep the image as small as possible, this way you won’t max out the GPU in your free Google Colab account.

If you want to keep your AI running for hours non-stop or you want to generate the maximum size the AI can handle, then you need a PRO Google Colab account.

### Step 4, Run The Art Generator.

{{< figure src="/img/post/ai_gen_output_screenshot.webp" width="480" height="910" alt="AI art generator output screenshot">}}

When you click on the play button on this code block, the AI will start the process of generating images.

The longer you keep the AI running the more detailed the image will be.

Once you’re happy with the results, you can stop the process by clicking on the stop button in this code block.

### Step 5, Download Generated Image.

To download the image to your computer, hover your mouse over the image and right-click on it.

Select a destination folder on your computer and click save.

### Step 6, Check For Copyright Issues.

I know that the AI generates images based on our input and the chance of copyright issues is very low, it is never 100% guaranteed.

Personally, I like to use <a href="https://tineye.com/" target="_blank">TinEye Reverse Image lookup</a>, it’s free and does a great job.

Keep in mind that there is no software that can give you a 100% guarantee, so use your own judgment.

## That’s It, Easy Right?

The great thing about this AI is that you don’t have to pay any monthly fees to create art, you can do it all right from within your own Google account.

If you made it this far and have not cloned the AI from my google drive yet, go to [https://thelazynfter.blog/ai](/ai/).

Complete a free offer and clone the AI directly into your google drive account.

No B.S just a free AI art generator. for everyone that sucks at drawing as I do
