There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the jurisdiction in which you are operating. Generally speaking, taking a screenshot of a digital asset that is not yours (typically referred to as an "infringement") is considered to be illegal in most jurisdictions.

This is because digital assets (including NFTs) are typically considered to be property rights and, as such, taking a screenshot of them without the owner's permission is considered to be an infringement of their right to ownership. 

In some cases, this may also constitute copyright infringement.

Some countries, such as the United States, may view taking screenshots of digital assets as a form of intellectual property theft, while other countries may not have a stance on the matter.

That is why I highly recommend reading the fine print and necessary disclaimers, plus contact the creator for permission before doing anything with other people’s hard work.

## What happens if you screenshot NFTs without permission?

If you screenshot an NFT without the owner's permission, you may be breaking the law. Theft of intellectual property, including NFTs, is a criminal offence in many countries. In some cases, simply taking an image of an NFT without the owner's permission can be punishable by law.

If you are unsure whether or not you are violating the law, it is best to avoid screenshotting NFTs at all cost. If you do choose to screenshot an NFT, be sure to take caution and ask the owner for permission first.

## Is it illegal to use an NFT screenshot as a profile picture?

In most cases, using an NFT as a profile picture is not illegal as long you have the proper rights. However, a few cases where using an NFT could be considered illegal.

For example, if you are using an NFT to represent your identity on social media, then using an NFT as your profile picture could be considered illegal. 

Additionally, using other people's NFTs to represent your company or organization could also be considered illegal.

## How do I report stolen NFT art?

When you see your art being sold on the same or other NFT marketplaces, you first need to report the art to the marketplace moderator.

In most cases, you can do this by clicking on the 3 dots below the artwork and hitting the report button.

This will notify the moderator of the marketplace and after you show the mods the proof that you are the rightful owner an investigation will be conducted.

There are some marketplaces that don’t have the function to report art theft, in these cases you want to contact the marketplace directly.

### Report NFT Art Theft To The Police.

If you believe that someone has stolen your NFT art, you should report the theft to the police. The police will then be able to investigate and determine if there is enough evidence to prosecute the perpetrator.

IYour second step is to contact the NFT art owner and provide them with the following information:

*   Your NFT art's unique identifier (e.g. "123456789123456")
*   The date and time the NFT art was stolen
*   A description of the NFT art

If the NFT art was stolen from a publicly accessible wallet, such as an online wallet or a desktop wallet, the owner may be able to find the artwork on the blockchain. 

## Can you sue if someone uses your NFT?

If someone uses your NFT without your permission, you can potentially sue them. 

Ownership of an NFT is determined by the blockchain transaction that created it, not by who originally owned the underlying assets. 

So if someone else created the NFT with your assets, you might be able to sue them for theft. 

However, if the NFT was created as part of a transaction that you yourself participated in, then the law may be on their side. 

In these cases, you would likely need to prove that you were the rightful owner of the assets used to create the NFT and that the other person had no right to use them.

## Summary

In some jurisdictions, screenshotting NFTs may be considered a criminal act, while in others it may be considered a legitimate exercise of free speech.

Some experts believe that taking screenshots of NFTs without the consent of the owners is an act of theft, while others argue that it is a protected form of free speech. The legality of screenshotting NFTs will largely depend on the specific laws in place in your country.
