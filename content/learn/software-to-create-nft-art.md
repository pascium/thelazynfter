There are many different types of NFT art, which can require a variety of different software programs.

While there are many other programs out there, the software's mentioned in this article are in my opinion the best suited for creating NFT and other art projects.

I know that listing a bunch of tools won't help you in picking the right one for your project.

So in the rest of this article I will explain to you the Pros and con’s of each one.

This way you know what tool to pick, scroll down and read what I think about these tools.

## Software Used To Make NFTs!

Nowadays, there are various software’s (free and paid) that you can use to create Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), below you find 4 of my favourite tools that you can use.
Adobe Photoshop.
Photoshop is a great way for artists who have a lot of experience and are willing to pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee to Adobe.

For beginners or people with a very tight budget I would not recommend Adobe Photoshop, unless you are planning to use Photoshop for your business.


### Adobe Photoshop

Photoshop is one of the more popular image manipulation software you can buy online.

This tool is used by professional photographers and artists around the world.

It has almost become the facto standard for artists to use when it comes to image manipulation programs, just because many pros are using it.

Because of this, I don’t like Photoshop.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great tool if you have the experience.

But for me it’s way too expensive and complicated to use.

**Photoshop Pros**

*   Wide range of build in tools.
*   Very powerful in the right hands.
*   Good customer support.
*   Many tutorials online.

**Photoshop Cons**

*   Monthly subscription.
*   Complex UI (user interface).
*   higher learning curve for absolute beginners.
*   Only for Windows and macOS.

### Blender.

The most powerful open source 3D modeling software you can get without spending a single dime.

You can make space models, VTUBER characters, 3D animations and the list goes on.

But just like Photoshop, Blender has a high learning curve.

That is why I recommend Blender to professionals, and not beginners that just want to make NFTs.

You are free to download and try it out for yourself, but be warned, you WILL need YouTube tutorials to get started.

**Blender Pros.**

*   Free.
*   Creating animations are built in.
*   You have full control.
*   Open source.
*   Many tutorials online.
*   Big community for support.
*   Supports Linux, Windows and macOS.
*   Layered textures design.
*   AMD, Apple, Intel, and NVIDIA hardware support.

**Blender Cons**

*   High learning curve.
*   Only community support.
*   Render engines can be hard on older systems resources.
*   No cloud storage syncing.

### Inkscape.

Is a free vector based program just like Photoshop, some say that Inkscape is the best free alternative for Adobe Photoshop.

While I understand why they say that, personally I think Photoshop has a nicer user interface and looks overall better than Inkscape.

But are looks and nicer interface worth the monthly expenses? That’s up to you to decide.

**Inkscape Pros.**

*   Free.
*   Vector based.
*   Supports Linux, Windows and macOS.
*   Broad file format compatibility.
*   Flexible drawing tools.
*   Bezier and spiro curves included.
*   Photoshop alternative.

**Inkscape Cons.**

*   Only community support.
*   No cloud storage syncing.
*   Similar look to photoshop.

### Google Draw.

Not the first web based program you think of NFT creation, but in the right hands it can be quite useful.

While you can’t do animations like in blender and photoshop, it’s free and anyone with a google account has direct access to it.

For an impression on what you can make with google draw.

Search for “Joshua Pomeroy google draw” in the YouTube search bar and watch his videos, they are awesome.

**Google Draw Pros.**

*   Cloud based.
*   Free for google users.
*   Build into google drive.
*   Easy to use.
*   Free geometric shapes.
*   SVG export supported.

**Google Draw Cons.**

*   Very simplistic.
*   No animations.
*   Lack of powerful tools.
*   Only basic shapes.

### AI Art Generators.

In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made huge leaps and bounds in the field of image recognition and generation. This has led to the development of AI art generators – computer programs that can create realistic or abstract artworks, without any human input.

Some of the most popular AI art generators are Google’s DeepDream and Prisma. Both of these programs are able to take a simple photo and turn it into a work of art, using various filters and algorithms.

There is no doubt that AI art generators are a fascinating new development in the world of art. However, some people are concerned that AI art generators are taking away the creativity of artists.

Others believe that these tools are simply providing a new way for artists to express themselves. The AI can create basic pieces of art, but it is up to the artist to add the finishing touches that


**AI Art Generator Pros.**

*   Can make any image you want.
*   Fast.
*   No coding skills needed.

**AI Art Generators Cons.**

*   Heavy on resources.
*   Need pro account for longer sessions.
*   Only GPU rendering is supported.
*   Commercial companies are expensive.
*   Self hosted needs high-end hardware.

### MagicaVoxel.

A free to use 3D voxel editor which you can use to create models or worlds for your games, animations, or other creative projects.

You don’t need any prior experience or skills in 3D modeling!

The program offers a wide range of tools and features that you can use to create your 3D designs. These include:

*   A variety of shapes and primitives that you can use as the basis for your designs.

*   Hard to adjust camera angle.
*   No support.
*   Bad model mesh exporting.

### Krita

Is a software program with many add-ons to help you make digital illustrations easier and more streamlined.

It allows you to upload your own image or an image you have permission to use and convert them to an NFT art piece.

You can also use their inbuilt templates to give some extra spice to your art.

This toolis free and lets you create and sell your digital assets on the Gnosis chain (formally called the xDai chain).

Great for absolute beginners but the current gas prices of the Ethereum network can be a bit high for beginners so keep that in mind.

**Nifty Ink Pros.**

*   Free.

**Nifty Ink Cons.**

### VoxEdit

One drawback I found is that you need to have an asset that is based on voxel to properly use this platform.

**VoxEdit Pros.**

*   Sell directly on the Metaverse sandbox market.

**VoxEdit Cons.**

The only drawback is that you have to wait a while for the art to be finished.

**Hotpot.ai Cons.**

*   Lack of customization options.

## NFT Software FAQ

In this section I will cover the most common ask questions you might have.

### Why you should use software to create your NFT art

There are many apps out there that make the creation of non-fungible tokens easier.

An example is CryptoKit. CryptoKit makes it easy to create your own NFTs on Ethereum, even if you don’t know how to write smart contracts.

Another app is CryptoZombies, where you can learn how to build dApps while also creating your own unique ERC-721 token.

The most popular NFT art we’ve seen was created using CryptoZombies and CryptoKit.

### Where to find your inspiration!

When you’re feeling uninspired and don’t know where to start with your next NFT project, it can be helpful to look to others for inspiration. Luckily, there are plenty of places to find interesting and creative examples of NFTs.

One great way to find inspiration is to browse online galleries and collections of NFTs. These galleries often showcase the best and most innovative work being done in the NFT space. Another option is to search for specific types of NFTs that interest you. This can help you find new and innovative ways to use NFTs in your






## Wrapping Things Up.

It all depends on the budget and what NFT you want to make.

If you lack drawing skill like me, then an AI art generator would be your best option.

When you want to turn your image manipulation skills into a job and work as a freelancer, then Photoshop is a no brainer.

For 3D rendering I always recommend Blender, it’s free plus you can do awesome stuff with it.

Blender can also be used in the movie and animation branch, so freelancing could be an option if you want to go into the entertainment industry.

But for the best experience possible I would recommend trying some of the tools on this list for yourself, only then will you be able to tell what tool suits your project.

Just keep in mind, what tools work for others, doesn't mean it will work for you. Not only that, but each project you will be working on will require different tools and workflow.
