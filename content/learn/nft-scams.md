NFTs are normally nothing special, but when they can sell for big bucks, scammers will try any tricks in the book to steal your crypto or wallet credentials.

NFT scams are nothing new. They occur every year because there is an abundance of gullible people who, despite having heard the warnings time and time again, still end up losing their money to someone's scam. 

In 2022, it may be a little harder to pull off the same old scams that we have come to know over the years.

## What are the different types of NFT scams to look out for?

NFT scam is one of the most common scams in the blockchain community. It is a type of scam that sells tokenized assets on a centralized exchange and continues to trade them as if it were an NFT. Therefore, its price will increase, and exchanges will add it to their books.

The scammer can sell the token at any time and make huge profits. The only people who get hurt are those who buy the token. The price of the token increases without any real value for the buyer or society.

The most common scams that you should be aware of include:

### Shills or shilling scams.

The first type of NFT scam is “shills”. Shills are basically like shilling on the internet for which people have been banned from different websites and social media platforms. They promote their token or coin to get more people to buy it. They do this by creating fake news and posting it on social media, forums, and other websites.

### Pump and Dump scams.

The second type of NFT scam is a “pump and dump” scheme. This is when someone builds up hype around a coin or token over social media and then dumps it right before it goes up in value. This is also

### NFT Artwork counterfeiting.

NFTs artworks are a kind of digital asset. From the beginning, they can be copied and replicated very easily. Although blockchain technology ensures that each token is unique, it is still possible to simply create a new token with the same artwork. This makes it very hard for collectors to verify whether or not the piece they have purchased is original.

The ArtChain Global platform will change this with its blockchain-based system for art authentication. With the help of this system, collectors will be able to verify the authenticity of their NFT artwork tokens, which will also protect them from being deceived by fake

### Fake non-fungible token exchanges.

In the world of blockchain, a non-fungible token is a digital token that is unique and can be owned by one person at a time. Non-fungible tokens are used to represent collectibles like CryptoKitties, in-game items like CryptoPunks, or even tickets like in Block Party.

A fake ERC-721 exchange is a service that allows people to trade their non-fungible tokens for other non-fungible tokens. The most popular service enables users to trade in-game items on the blockchain, thereby allowing for the growth of a secondary market. You can read more about it here:

### Fake NFTe token games.

I’m not sure how many other people have noticed it, but there are a lot of fake NFTe token games out there.

The goal of these games is to get you to buy Ethereum with your own money and buy in-game tokens with it, but you get fake coins instead.

This way you lose your Ethereum assets and there is no way of getting them back, the scammer can do anything with the Ethereum because it is decentralized without any oversight from banks and financial institutions.

### Discord DM’s

This is a cam where the scammer contacts you via discord pretending to be a well-known NFT marketplace or some sort of influencer.

It is not unlikely to be contacted by influencers on Discord, that is why it’s such an effective scam.

Just keep in mind that, when you are in a large group or “Discord server” the higher the chance of being contacted by a scammer.

### Social Media Engineering.

Everyone knows that social media platforms have a large number of fake profiles, also known as trolls or bot accounts.

But some accounts have been copied by others so that they can pretend to be a celebrity and interact with their audience, to gain access to the victim's crypto wallet.

I know that it sounds so obvious but there are still people falling for these, so it’s good to mention this scam in this list.

### Website Phishing.

This is where the “bad guy” completely copies the real website from design to functionality like the original.

The user won't notice that something is wrong, but when they have logged in with their wallet the scammer has complete control of their wallet.

By the time you find out that something is wrong, the scammer has changed the 12-digit seed phrase and password and locked you out of your wallet.

That is why you always check the URL of the website before logging in and report to the website owner if something looks suspicious.

### Rugg Pull Scams.

This scam is very similar to the pump and dump scheme.

Scammers will launch a coin or NFT project and create some hype around it so that investors will buy “invest” some amount of crypto into it.

When the scammer thinks it has milked their investors dry, they will transfer the wallet amount to somewhere else and delete all their social media accounts and websites without any notice.

Leavin the investors with a bad taste in their mouth and a crypto amount they cannot get back.

### NFT Checkout Scams.

This is where the scammer auctions off an NFT but changes the price on checkout when someone adds a bid and the scammer accepts the bid.

Let’s say I auctioned an NFT for 0,0139051888602751 ETH which is equal to $25, but when I remove one 0 after the comma it will be 0,139051888602751 ETH and this is $250 worth.

At first glance you will not notice a difference unless you send crypto daily, otherwise, you will find out when the amount is withdrawn from your wallet.
