So you have bought an NFT from a marketplace, and now you want to convert it into cash for some reason.

**_Unfortunately, you cannot exchange NFT artwork directly for money._**

**_The only way to get money for your NFT artwork is to sell it on a marketplace like OpenSea._**

Of course, there are other ways to get money for your NFT but 90% of such sites are [NFT scams](/learn/nft-scams/).

That's why I also advise anyone reading this to only sell your artwork on sites like OpenSea.

If you prefer not to use a Marketplace, you should have your own website made where visitors can immediately mint your NFT.

But this is real if you have a big name because such a special blockchain website can be quite expensive.

## Can you sell nft for anything?

If you use OpenSea, you must sell your NFT for a minimum of $5.

You should also take into account that OpenSea itself keeps 2.5% of the sold amount.

## Is NFT easy to sell?

Personally, I have tried several times to sell my NFT art on OpenSea.

In total, I have sold 10 artworks for $5 each in a span of about a year.

So yes, it is quite difficult to sell your artwork if you do not have many followers on social media that want to buy from you or know how to market your NFT online.

Not only that, but the amount of artwork that is available on these marketplaces is just too much for a newbie to compete at.

But don’t let that stop you, just try it for yourself and see what you think of selling on these marketplaces.

If you decide to sell your art as an NFT, then I recommend you use the Polygon network to sell your first artwork.

On this network, you pay almost no gas if you put your artwork up for sale compared to Ethereum where you spend on average between 30 and $250 in gas fees.

## How much is my NFT worth?

That's really hard to say, you as an artist will always think your art is worth more than what someone else thinks of it.

You may think your art is worth $100, while someone else isn't willing to pay more than $5 for your artwork.

Look at Van Gogh, his art was worth next to nothing when he was alive plus nobody wanted to buy his art, but now it's worth millions.

That is why it is so difficult to give a correct price tag to art.

## Should I buy NFT art?

It all depends on what you want to do with it, do you want to buy it to resell it for a profit or do you just want to buy it for yourself?

If you're buying it to make money from it, then I suggest you don't.

It is difficult to sell NFT art for a profit if you do not know what you are doing.

If you want to buy something for yourself because you like it, you have to ask yourself whether it is worth your money and if you have the funds without getting into financial diffeculties..

But before you buy an NFT from someone, you should do a decent amount of research on the person and the art they are selling.

Because more and more people are coming online that want to sell art as NFT that is not legally theirs.

These individuals just want to make a quick buck no matter how they do it.

## Summary

NFT art can only be exchanged for money by selling it on platforms such as OpenSea and Rarible.

But whichever platforms you choose, always look carefully at what the platform charges for fees and what the gas price is at that time.

Otherwise, you may well make a loss because the gas price is more expensive than the asking price of your NFT.
