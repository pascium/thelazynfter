                    <p>With AI image generation, you can create unique images automatically, without the need for a graphic designer.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>This can be incredibly helpful for businesses who need to create images for marketing purposes, or for use in product packaging.</p>
                    <p>But most of us just want to use a free AI generator to create non-fungible token art &ldquo;NFT&rdquo;, some also call it cryptographic art.</p>
                    <p>Personally, I use the free artificial intelligence tool to create my featured image at the top of my articles like the one you saw in the beginning of this article.</p>
                    <p>If you are in a hurry and don&rsquo;t want to keep reading this article, then head over to my free <a href="/learn/ai-art-generator.html"><strong>ai art generator</strong></a> guide where I explain step-by step how to get and
                        use an AI generator for free.</p>
                    <p>For the rest of you who would like to know more about free AII art generators, here is an outline with clickable links that take you directly to the section you are interested in.</p>

                    <h2>How can I make AI art for free?</h2>
                    <p>You can use an online art generator that uses AI, or you can create a line art generator with Python.</p>
                    <p>Art generators that you find online are great but come with 1 drawback, you need to buy credits to finish your artwork.</p>
                    <p>Creating an Ai-based art generator with Python is also free but you need to know how to code with Python and it takes a lot of time to complete.</p>
                    <h2>What is the best free AI art Generator?</h2>
                    <p>3 art generators use AI that I would recommend. Below you will find links to the website of these tools including the pros and cons of each AI art generator.</p>
                    <h3><a href="/learn/ai-art-generator.html">Google AI Art Generator.</a></h3>
                    <p>OK, It&rsquo;s not an AI art generator from Google, but it uses the free google colab platform for running the art gen.</p>
                    <p>Just like the Nightcafe one, this uses the VQGAN neural network for tokenizing your text input and outputting an image.</p>
                    <p>With each pass, the neural network will teach and modify itself so that each iteration of the image will be better and better</p>

                    <p>This is a real online art generator that uses AI. You need to enter a short description of the art and what it must be about and pick from 3 different style types.</p>

                    <p>If you want more artwork or the end result is not to your liking, then you need to earn credits by joining and participating on their online community.</p>
