                    <p>With the recent explosion of interest in NFTs (non-fungible tokens), it's important to be aware of the ethical and etiquette considerations around taking screenshots of these digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In this blog post, we'll explore some of the potential pitfalls of taking screenshots of NFTs and offer some etiquette tips to avoid them.</p>
                    <p>But before that, let's first start with the basics and explain&hellip;</p>
                </header>

                <div class="single-page__content">
                    <h2>What is an nft screenshot?</h2>
                    <p>A screenshot is a digital representation of what someone sees on their computer screen.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Screenshots are often taken while playing video games, watching videos, browsing websites, or using software applications.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>When you take a screenshot, you capture the image displayed on your monitor onto a file called a screenshot.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>You can then save the screenshot to your hard drive or upload it to a website where others can view it.</p>
                    <p>Screenshots are often saved to a file called a.png (Portable Network Graphics) or.jpeg (Joint Photographic Experts Group).</p>
                    <p>Now that we know what a screenshot is, it&rsquo;s time to figure out&hellip;.</p>
                    <h2>How to screenshot an nft.</h2>
                    <p>There are two ways to take screenshots. You can either use a third party extension or you can use the native OS feature.</p>
                    <h3>Taking Screenshots in Firefox</h3>
                    <p>To take a screenshot in Firefox, you need to navigate to the page you want to take a screenshot of and right-click on that page.</p>
                    <p>After right clicking you need to select from the popup menu the option &rdquo;take screenshot&rdquo;.</p>
                    <p>Now you can select what screenshot you want, you can take a screenshot of the visible part of the page, of the whole page or use your mouse to select a specific part on the webpage.</p>
                    <h3>Taking Screenshots in Android.</h3>
                    <p>If you'd rather not use any third-party apps, you can simply press the power button and the volume buttons at the same time.</p>
                    <p>A popup screen should appear and allow you to select what you want to capture. Tap on the image icon and you're done!</p>
                    <h2>Where is your screenshot stored?</h2>
                    <p>Screenshots are saved in the following location:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>&nbsp;Windows 10: %USERPROFILE%\Pictures\Screenshots</li>
                        <li>&nbsp;Mac OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Apple/SharedSupport/ScreenshotCapture</li>
                        <li>&nbsp;Linux: ~/.local/share/applications/screenshotcapture.desktop</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If you want to find out where a screenshot was taken, open the file manager (Windows Explorer, Finder, etc.) and navigate to the directory above.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>You should see a folder named Screenshots inside the Pictures folder. Inside this folder, you'll find the screenshots you took.</p>

                    <h2>Best practices for using screenshot NFTs.</h2>
                    <p>No matter what screenshot you use, always and alway make sure that you have the proper permissions or rights to use the screenshot or any other images for that matter.</p>
                    <p>If you write articles like me, and want to add some images to spice up your blogpost, you can use screenshots but you need to add the proper credit of the one that made the original image as a figcaption including a link back
                        to the original source.</p>
                    <p>But if you are unsure if you can use a screenshot of a webpage, NFT or any other image, just send the original owner an email and ask for permission.</p>

                    <h2>Why would you buy an NFT when you can screenshot it?</h2>
                    <p>NFT represents ownership of a real estate property. If you own a house, you have a legal claim to the land where the house sits.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>That land could be represented by an NFT. In the same way, if you own a car, you have a legal right to drive it anywhere in the country.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>That vehicle could be represented by an ERC20 token.</p>
                    <p>When you purchase an NFT, you're essentially buying a virtual licence to use it how you see fit.</p>
                    <h2>Can you get sued for Screenshotting an NFT?</h2>
                    <p>Yes! You can be sued for screenshotting an NFT (Non-Fungible Token). However, if you do not have any intent to sell the token, then you should be fine.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>If you intend to resell the tokens, then you may need to make sure that you don't violate any terms of service agreements.</p>
                    <h2>Can I sell someone else's art as NFT?</h2>
                    <p>Yes! You can sell someone else's art (or anything) as non-fungible tokens. You just need to make sure that they have given their consent to do so.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In order to do so, you would first need to create a contract between yourself and the person who owns the artwork.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Once you've done so, you could then use the ERC-777 standard to transfer ownership of the token to the buyer.</p>
                    <p>Selling art without proper licence, consent or using copyrighted characters is a copyright infringement and can lead to huge fines.</p>
                    <h2>Do I need to copyright NFT?</h2>
                    <p>You do not need to copyright your NFT's. However, if you want to protect your work, then you should copyright them.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Copyrighting your work helps to ensure that no one else uses your design without permission.</p>
                    <h2>Do I own an NFT if I mint it?</h2>
                    <p>The short answer is yes. You do own an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) even if you don't intend to use it.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Minting an NFT does not make it any less of an asset. In fact, it makes it more valuable.</p>
                    <h2>How should I handle screenshots</h2>
                    <p>As a screenshot artist, you should always give proper attribution to the original creator.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>This means crediting the person who created the image, whether it was a video game, movie, book, etc. If you don't, the copyright holder has the right to take legal action against you.</p>

                    <h2>Summary.</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Always ask permission before taking a screenshot of anything that belongs to someone else.</li>
                        <li>Never use a screenshot to represent something that cannot be represented digitally.</li>
