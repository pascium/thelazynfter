                    <p>AI art generator from text is a tool that helps you create beautiful pictures using only text.</p>
                    <p>There are several tools out there that allow you to generate images from text. The problem is that they often require a large amount of data or a complicated algorithm.</p>
                    <p>However, in this guide I will share with you a simple AI art generator that can generate unique images without monthly fees.</p>
                    <p>To help you get started even faster, I will explain to you how to download the art generator that I personally use on a daily basis for creating art for my blog thelazynfter.</p>
                    <p>Plus how to set it up in your own google account.</p>
                </header>

                <div class="single-page__content">
                    <h2>What is an AI art generator?</h2>
                    <p>This is a custom made script (code) usually made with Python 2.7 or Python 3.5 and uses a neural network model that is pre-trained on different types of images and art.</p>
                    <h2>How does AI create art?</h2>
                    <p>Machine learning will take your text input and convert it into tokens (tokenizing), it will then use these tokens as a set of rules when using the Gan model in combination with ImageNet 1024.</p>
                    <p>It will then output images and compare each image against each other based on the rules, it will then determine if the output is successful or not.</p>
                    <p>This process will continue until the losses reach 0 or the differences in the losses are not changing.</p>
                    <h2>What is Gan art?</h2>
                    <p>Gan or generative adversarial networks, is a machine learning model that was created in 2014.</p>
                    <p>It uses a so-called &ldquo;discriminator&rdquo; factor system that compares generated images with each other to determine the ones that are successful.</p>
                    <h2>How do you use AI text to art generator?</h2>
                    <p>Now that you know what an art generator is and how it works, it&rsquo;s time to explain how you can use it yourself.</p>
                    <p>Below you will find a simple 9 step plan on how to accomplish this.</p>
                    <h3>Step 1: download art generator.</h3>
                    <p>To get the updated (latest) version of the AI art generator, follow the steps below.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><a href="https://rushingfolder.com/artgeneratorai" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Click to access the art generator</a>. (#ad)</li>
                        <li>Complete a free (affiliate) offer.</li>
                        <li>After completing an offer you will be redirected to the ai art generator. (no b.s)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Step 2: copy to your drive.</h3>
                    <figure><img src="/img/blog/copy_to_drive.webp" alt="google colab save to drive screenshot" width="835" height="470" />
                        <figcaption>
                            <small>google colab save to drive screenshot</small>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Now you are in my google colab account, to make sure that all of your progress is saved you must copy the art generator to your own google drive.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Click on file in the top left corner.</li>
                        <li>Select save a copy in drive.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Never run the generator without copying it to your account otherwise you will lose every progress you made, plus if for some reason my account is closed you will always have the art generator in your account.</p>
                    <h3>Step 3: select GPU runtime and connect.</h3>
                    <figure><img src="/img/blog/select_runtime.webp" alt="google colab select run time screenshot" width="835" height="470" />
                        <figcaption>
                            <small>google colab select run time screenshot</small>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>In most accounts the GPU runtime is selected by default but it&rsquo;s a good idea to check and make sure it&rsquo;s selected.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In the top menu click on runtime.</li>
                        <li>In the dropdown click on change runtime type.</li>
                        <li>Now a popup appears.</li>
                        <li>Select in the Hardware accelerator dropdown &ldquo;GPU&rdquo; and not TPU.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Step 4: download necessaire Python packages.</h3>
                    <figure><img src="/img/blog/python_packages.webp" alt="google colab download all packages screenshot" width="835" height="470" />
                        <figcaption>
                            <small>google colab download all packages screenshot</small>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Now that everything is set up correctly and the runtime is set to GPU, it&rsquo;s time to download all the Python packages the art generator needs.</p>
                    <p>This is very simple, click on &ldquo;Download Everything&rdquo; and the tool does the rest.</p>
                    <h3>Step 5: Write a description and set canvas sizes.</h3>
                    <figure><img src="/img/blog/set_parameters.webp" alt="google colab set parameters screenshot" width="835" height="470" />
                        <figcaption>
                            <small>google colab set parameters screenshot</small>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>In the &ldquo;Art Generator Parameters&rsquo;&rsquo; you will need to write a short description of what the image must contain, example: &ldquo;sci-fi city at night unreal engine&rdquo;.</p>
                    <p>For the pixel size for your art work, you could go to the max of 500X500px but I would recommend not going above 300X300px.</p>
                    <p>Reason for this is to limit the amount of resources the free GPU uses. You could go higher but your account could get banned.</p>
                    <p>If you need to run the art generator for a longer period of time or need the max pixel size, then you need to buy the google collab pro version.</p>
                    <h3>Step 6: Run the art generator.</h3>
                    <figure><img src="/img/blog/run_generator.webp" alt="google colab start generator screenshot" width="835" height="470" />
                        <figcaption>
                            <small>google colab start generator screenshot</small>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Now the generator knows what content and size the image must be, it can now go to work and output your images.</p>
                    <p>This process can take a few minutes or a few hours depending on how long YOU let it run.</p>
                    <p>Onces you&rsquo;re satisfied with the outcome, click on the stop button in this code block.</p>
                    <h3>Step 7: Export your artwork.</h3>
                    <p>To download your &ldquo;artwork&rdquo; to your computer, just hover your mouse cursor over the image and right click on it.</p>
                    <p>Now select &ldquo;save image as&rdquo;, and pick the folder where you like to save the image on you computer and click on save in the bottom right corner.</p>
                    <h3>Step 8: image upscaling.</h3>
                    <p>Congratulations, you have now created your first AI powered image.</p>
                    <p>But there is a problem, 300X300px is not much and a bigger version would be nice without having to pay for a google colab pro account.</p>
                    <p>That is where the image upscaler coes in, this tool will scale any image from 500x500 image to maximum 1760x1760 pixels with no quality loss.</p>
                    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry it&rsquo;s free and it runs just like the art generator right in your google drive.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><a href="https://rushingfolder.com/imageupscalerai" target="blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Click to access the AI Upscaler</a>. (#ad)</li>
                        <li>Complete a free (affiliate) offer.</li>
                        <li>Click file in the top left and select save a copy in drive.</li>
                        <li>Follow the steps in the image upscaler.</li>
                        <li>Your image will be enhanced and downloaded in a ZIP file.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Step 9: Done.</h3>
                    <p>If everything should go like it should, you now have an AI generated image plus it&rsquo;s upscaled to the max without getting your account banned.</p>
                    <p>There is a possibility that the generator won&rsquo;t work if you don&rsquo;t run it in chrome or if you have third-party cookies disabled.</p>
                    <p>So make sure that third-party cookies are enabled for google and you run the art generator in the latest version of google chrome.</p>
                    <h2>Best way to check for AI art copyrights.</h2>
                    <p>I know that it sounds silly to check for image copyrights if the AI can create &ldquo;unique&rdquo; art, but in my opinion it&rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry.</p>
                    <p>For this task I use the following tools to check if an image is used somewhere else or is copyrighted.</p>
                    <h3>Google reverse image lookup.</h3>
                    <figure><img src="/img/blog/google_image.webp" alt="screenshot google image search" width="835" height="470" />
                        <figcaption>
                            <small>screenshot google image search</small>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>You can find the google reverse image lookup tool in your google account or go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.nl/imghp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">google image search</a>.</p>
                    <p>Another great tool you can use to check image copyrights is&hellip;.</p>
                    <h3>Tineye</h3>
                    <figure><img src="/img/blog/tin_eye.webp" alt="tineye reverse image lookup screenshot" width="835" height="470" />
                        <figcaption>
                            <small>tineye reverse image lookup screenshot</small>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>To use tineye, you can go to their official website&nbsp;<a href="https://tineye.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tineye</a>&nbsp;and upload your image in their image search bar.</p>
                    <h2>Closing thoughts.</h2>
                    <p>While this is a great way to create &ldquo;art&rdquo; images for non-artist and artist&rsquo;s that want to save time, you still have to use your own judgement when using these types of tools.</p>
                    <p>Always keep these things in mind.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don&rsquo;t steal other people&rsquo;s work.</li>
                        <li>Don&rsquo;t copy others&rsquo; work but take inspiration from it.</li>
                        <li>Always check for copyright issues.</li>
                        <li>Ask permission before using or buy their licence.</li>
                        <li>Give credit where credit is due.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Thanks for taking your time to finish this guide, if you know anyone that can use this guide or you want to help spread the word, feel free to share it on your favourite social media platform.</p>
