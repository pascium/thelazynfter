                    <h2>Software Used To Make NFTs!</h2>
                    <p>Nowadays, there are various software&rsquo;s (free and paid) that you can use to create Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), below you find 4 of my favourite tools that you can use. Adobe Photoshop. Photoshop is a great way for artists
                        who have a lot of experience and are willing to pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee to Adobe.</p>
                    <p>For beginners or people with a very tight budget I would not recommend Adobe Photoshop, unless you are planning to use Photoshop for your business.</p>
                    <h3>Adobe Photoshop</h3>
                    <p>Photoshop is one of the more popular image manipulation software you can buy online.</p>
                    <p>This tool is used by professional photographers and artists around the world.</p>
                    <p>It has almost become the facto standard for artists to use when it comes to image manipulation programs, just because many pros are using it.</p>
                    <p>Because of this, I don&rsquo;t like Photoshop.</p>
                    <p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s a great tool if you have the experience.</p>
                    <p>But for me it&rsquo;s way too expensive and complicated to use.</p>
                    <p><strong>Photoshop Pros</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wide range of build in tools.</li>
                        <li>Very powerful in the right hands.</li>
                        <li>Good customer support.</li>
                        <li>Many tutorials online.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Photoshop Cons</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monthly subscription.</li>
                        <li>Complex UI (user interface).</li>
                        <li>higher learning curve for absolute beginners.</li>
                        <li>Only for Windows and macOS.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Blender.</h3>
                    <p>The most powerful open source 3D modeling software you can get without spending a single dime.</p>
                    <p>You can make space models, VTUBER characters, 3D animations and the list goes on.</p>
                    <p>But just like Photoshop, Blender has a high learning curve.</p>
                    <p>That is why I recommend Blender to professionals, and not beginners that just want to make NFTs.</p>
                    <p>You are free to download and try it out for yourself, but be warned, you WILL need YouTube tutorials to get started.</p>

                        <li>No cloud storage syncing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Inkscape.</h3>
                    <p>Is a free vector based program just like Photoshop, some say that Inkscape is the best free alternative for Adobe Photoshop.</p>
                    <p>While I understand why they say that, personally I think Photoshop has a nicer user interface and looks overall better than Inkscape.</p>
                    <p>But are looks and nicer interface worth the monthly expenses? That&rsquo;s up to you to decide.</p>
                    <p><strong>Inkscape Pros.</strong></p>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>Google Draw.</h3>
                    <p>Not the first web based program you think of NFT creation, but in the right hands it can be quite useful.</p>
                    <p>While you can&rsquo;t do animations like in blender and photoshop, it&rsquo;s free and anyone with a google account has direct access to it.</p>
                    <p>For an impression on what you can make with google draw.</p>

                    <h3>AI Art Generators.</h3>
                    <p>In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made huge leaps and bounds in the field of image recognition and generation. This has led to the development of AI art generators &ndash; computer programs that can create
                        realistic or abstract artworks, without any human input.</p>
                    <p>Some of the most popular AI art generators are Google&rsquo;s DeepDream and Prisma. Both of these programs are able to take a simple photo and turn it into a work of art, using various filters and algorithms.</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt that AI art generators are a fascinating new development in the world of art. However, some people are concerned that AI art generators are taking away the creativity of artists.</p>
                    <p>Others believe that these tools are simply providing a new way for artists to express themselves. The AI can create basic pieces of art, but it is up to the artist to add the finishing touches that</p>

                    <h2>NFT Software FAQ</h2>
                    <p>In this section I will cover the most common ask questions you might have.</p>
                    <h3>Why you should use software to create your NFT art</h3>
                    <p>There are many apps out there that make the creation of non-fungible tokens easier.</p>
                    <p>An example is CryptoKit. CryptoKit makes it easy to create your own NFTs on Ethereum, even if you don&rsquo;t know how to write smart contracts.</p>
                    <p>Another app is CryptoZombies, where you can learn how to build dApps while also creating your own unique ERC-721 token.</p>
                    <p>The most popular NFT art we&rsquo;ve seen was created using CryptoZombies and CryptoKit.</p>
                    <h3>Where to find your inspiration!</h3>
                    <p>When you&rsquo;re feeling uninspired and don&rsquo;t know where to start with your next NFT project, it can be helpful to look to others for inspiration. Luckily, there are plenty of places to find interesting and creative
                        examples of NFTs.</p>
                    <p>One great way to find inspiration is to browse online galleries and collections of NFTs. These galleries often showcase the best and most innovative work being done in the NFT space. Another option is to search for specific
                        types of NFTs that interest you. This can help you find new and innovative ways to use NFTs in your</p>
                    <h2>Wrapping Things Up.</h2>
                    <p>It all depends on the budget and what NFT you want to make.</p>
                    <p>If you lack drawing skill like me, then an AI art generator would be your best option.</p>
                    <p>When you want to turn your image manipulation skills into a job and work as a freelancer, then Photoshop is a no brainer.</p>
                    <p>For 3D rendering I always recommend Blender, it&rsquo;s free plus you can do awesome stuff with it.</p>
                    <p>Blender can also be used in the movie and animation branch, so freelancing could be an option if you want to go into the entertainment industry.</p>
                    <p>But for the best experience possible I would recommend trying some of the tools on this list for yourself, only then will you be able to tell what tool suits your project.</p>
                    <p>Just keep in mind, what tools work for others, doesn&rsquo;t mean it will work for you. Not only that, but each project you will be working on will require different tools and workflow.</p>
