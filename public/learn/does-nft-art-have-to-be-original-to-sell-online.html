                    <p>When selling art online, you should always ask yourself whether or not you want to create original artwork.</p>
                    <p><strong>But it does not have to be something that you have created by yourself, you can also buy a license of another artist and sell his art instead.</strong></p>
                    <p>While this is the easiest way, it still comes with many limitations, that is why I always tell people to make their own stuff.</p>
                    <p>This is because original artwork has a higher value, meaning you&rsquo;ll get paid more for it. You also have less issues with copyright infringement.</p>
                    <p>The reason why they fail is because they try to sell their original artwork without knowing anything about the art market.</p>
                    <p>That is why it&rsquo;s so important to know the art market in and out, plus how to market your art to the right people.</p>
                    <p>You can also decide to create your own artwork with a free AI art generator which can generate unique art without copyright issues or licensing fees.</p>

                <div class="single-page__content">
                    <h2>Can you sell NFT of someone else&rsquo;s art?</h2>
                    <p>I think the answer is yes, if you have permission and license from the artist. If you don&rsquo;t have permission or have the proper licenses, then no.</p>
                    <p>So, if you want to sell something online, you need to make sure you own the rights to it.</p>
                    <p>If you don&rsquo;t own the rights to the piece of art, then you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to sell it. In fact, you might even get sued if you try to sell something without the proper permissions.</p>
                    <p>You could also create your own artwork, and then sell prints of it. That way, you own the rights to the artwork, and you can sell any number of copies of it without having to ask anyone for permission.</p>
                    <h2>What can I sell as NFT?</h2>
                    <p>There are a few things that can be sold as NFTs. Some popular examples include digital assets, property, and tokens.digital assets&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Digital assets can be sold as NFTs because they are unique and can represent a specific piece of information.</p>
                    <p>Property can also be sold as NFTs. This is because property can be a physical or digital asset.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>For example, a house can be sold as a digital asset. This means that the property can be transferred and traded just like a digital asset.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2>Is it hard to sell NFT art?</h2>
                    <p>If you are new and have no followers that are willing to buy or promote your art, then yes, it&rsquo;s hard to get started in the NFT art space.</p>
                    <p>Selling NFT art is pretty much the same as any other type of art.You need to find someone who wants what you&rsquo;re selling and is willing to pay for it.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>There are many ways to go about doing this.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>Here are some tips to get you started:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure you know how to use photoshop (or similar software) before starting out. If you don&rsquo;t know how to use Photoshop, then learn now.</li>
                        <li>Start small. Don&rsquo;t try to make a million dollar business right off the bat. Start slow and build up slowly.</li>
                        <li>Find people who want what you&rsquo;re selling. Do research online and find forums where people talk about their favorite products. Look for people who post pictures of their favorite products and ask them if they would be
                            interested in buying something.</li>
                        <li>Be patient. It takes time to build up a good customer base.</li>
                        <li>Always keep your prices low. People will buy more if they feel like they got a deal.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Where can I sell NFT art?</h2>
                    <p>There are a lot of places that you can visit to sell your NFT art work, here are some of my favorite marketplaces that are designed for selling and buying NFTs.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>OpenSea.</li>
                        <li>Rarible.</li>
                        <li>Foundation.</li>

                        <li>BakerySwap.</li>
                        <li>AtomicHub.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Can you make an NFT of copyrighted material?</h2>
                    <p>If you plan to distribute them publicly (such as selling them online), then you need to get permission from the copyright holder first. If you do not have permission to use the content, please do not upload it.</p>
                    <p>Copyrighted materials belong to their rightful owners. I do not condone using copyrighted materials without consenting to the original owner.</p>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>While you can sell NFT artwork with the proper permission and license, I highly recommend you make your own art or hire someone on Fiverr to make one for you.</p>
                    <p>The last option will require a small investment (money wise), it is still cheaper than buying a license or paying for copyright infringement that you have committed.</p>
